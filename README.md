# Florida Cloud Simulation

This was a cloud simulation that I coded in Java as a side project in high school. Specifically, I took data on wind direction, temperature, and humidity in Florida to estimate the movement and formation of clouds.

## Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/guor8lei/florida-cloud-simulation.git`
2. Open up Eclipse (or preferred IDE)
3. (Eclipse only) Click on `File >> Import`
4. (Eclipse only) Click on `Git >> Projects from Git >> Next >> Existing local repository >> Next >> Add`
5. (Eclipse only) For the Directory field, click `Browse` and select the `florida-cloud-simulation` folder that you just cloned
6. (Eclipse only) Check the checkbox and click `Finish`
7. (Eclipse only) Click `Next >> Finish`
